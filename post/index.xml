      <description>This is an R Notebook: a document containing code and text. A live version can be run through MyBinder, which will spin up a copy of R-studio for you to use, and the source code is available on GitHub.
Clicking on the MyBinder link above will bring you to an R-Studio instance. In the ‘files’ window in the bottom-right of R-studio, open the document ‘r_and_wikidata.Rmd’, which will open this with a live copy of the code, which can be edited and re-run.</description>

      <description>You can’t search for women in the State Papers Online. There’s no way of knowing how many letters they wrote, or received, or how often they were mentioned. If you know the name you’re looking for you can search through the descriptions and abstracts, but you would need to watch out for spelling variants or mistakes. This method also doesn’t help estimate how many letters there are overall, and it limits the possibility of the chance discovery of women’s writing in the archive.</description>

      <description>Text and Models What can a body of text tell us about the worldview of its authors? Many Digital Humanities projects involve constructing models: a general name for a kind of representation of something which makes it in some way easier to interpret. TEI-encoded text is an example of a model: we take the ‘raw material’ of a document, its text, and add elements to it to make it easier to work with and analyse.</description>

      <description>Calendars of State Papers and Networking Archives Most of the Networking Archives project has been using the metadata, or data about, the digitised correspondence from the State Papers Online. Metadata in this sense means everything except the content of the letters: including author names, recipient names, date, place of sending and so on, in the research of seventeenth-century intelligencing. Gale State Papers Online brings together a number of historical primary sources, connecting the original manuscript images from the State Papers with the ‘Calendars of State Papers’, a printed resource.</description>
